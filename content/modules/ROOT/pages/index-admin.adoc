This is the admin guide. In this setup, we will show how to install and configure both operators. We will also explain purpose of such settings.

== Setting up the environment

. Go into the terminal on the right and run the following commands:
* Log into azure CLI: `az login --service-principal --username={azure_service_principal_id} --password={azure_service_principal_password} --tenant={azure_tenant_id}`
* Export the `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` variable. It will needed when setting up the operator:
`export AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP={azure_resource_group}`

. If you need to use the web UI (not necessary in this workshop):
* Navigate to the {aro_console}[Openshift Console, window=blank]
* Login as administrator:
** *Username:* {aro_kube_username}
** *Password:* {aro_kube_password}

If you are running this workshop from an Azure self managed OCP cluster, note that there are very small tweaks to follow, but they are too documented in this guide.
