= Theory

In this section, we will focus on explaining the high level workflow and theory behind these two operators:

* The xref:osc.adoc[Openshift sandboxed containers operator], which provides confidential containers. This operator is installed in the **untrusted cluster**, and is in charge of providing the necessary software stack to deploy confidential containers
* The xref:trustee.adoc[Trustee operator], which acts as remote attester. This operator is installed in a **trusted environment**, and is in charge of attesting that the deployed confidential container is actually running in a confidential environment.
