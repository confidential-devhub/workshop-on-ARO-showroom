= Configure the Trustee operator

Now that the Trustee operator is installed, we need to set it up.

[#trustee-route]
== Create a route for Trustee

Create a secure route with edge TLS termination for Trustee. External ingress traffic reaches the router pods as HTTPS and passes on to the Trustee pods as HTTP.

Create a route and set the `TRUSTEE_HOST` variable. This variable will be useful later when we set the xref:02-configure-osc.adoc#pp-cm[peer-pods ConfigMap]. In this workshop, we will create an unprotecred `http` route. This is not for production usage.

NOTE: Currently, only a route with a valid CA-signed certificate is supported. It is not possible to use a route with self-signed certificate. Therefore, we will create an `http` unsecure route instead of `https` and enable `insecure_http` in the xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-cm[Trustee config] to allow such connection. This is not a supported approach for production and just useful for trying everything in a single cluster.

[#trustee-initdata]
== The initdata policy

=== About initdata

This step will be also useful in the xref:02-configure-osc.adoc#pp-cm[OSC operator setup]. However, since this policy is part of the attestation and we need the expected PCR to be added in the Trustee reference values, we will create the file now.

The initdata specification provides a flexible way to initialize a CoCo peer pod with sensitive or workload-specific data at runtime, avoiding the need to embed such data in the virtual machine (VM) image. This enhances security by reducing exposure of confidential information and improves flexibility by eliminating custom image builds. For example, initdata can include three configuration settings:

* An X.509 certificate for secure communication.
* A cryptographic key for authentication.
* An optional Kata Agent policy.rego file to enforce runtime behavior when overriding the default Kata Agent policy.

We can apply an initdata configuration by using one of the following methods:

* Globally by including it in the peer pods config map, setting a cluster-wide default for all pods.
* For a specific pod when configuring a pod workload object, allowing customization for individual workloads.
+
The `io.katacontainers.config.runtime.cc_init_data` annotation under `metadata:annotations:` in the pod yaml spec overrides the global `INITDATA` setting in the xref:02-configure-osc.adoc#pp-cm[peer pods config map] for that specific pod. The Kata runtime handles this precedence automatically at pod creation time.

The initdata content configures the following components:

* Attestation Agent (AA), which verifies the trustworthiness of the peer pod by sending evidence to the Trustee for attestation.
* Confidential Data Hub (CDH), which manages secrets and secure data access within the peer pod VM.
* Kata Agent, which enforces runtime policies and manages the lifecycle of the containers inside the pod VM.

[#trustee-ip]
=== Create the initdata policy

In this section, we will create the initdata that will be later set up as global in the xref:02-configure-osc.adoc#pp-cm[OSC operator configmap].

In this policy, we will set the Trustee address in the internal CVM components. We will use `TRUSTEE_HOST` defined previously when xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-route[configuring the Trustee].

IMPORTANT: **Why do we add this to the Trustee reference values?** Remember that this policy is actually added into the OSC operator Configmap, or injected as pod annotation at deployment time. Both scenarios are happening outside the trusted zone, meaning a rogue admin can simply change these values and connect the CoCo pod to a different Trustee, use insecure `http` and so on.

----

Note that if `TRUSTEE_HOST` uses HTTPS with a CA-signed certificate (necessary for production environments), the certificate has to be added by uncommenting the block in `cert` under `[token_config.kbs]` and the one in `kbs_cert` under `[kbc]`. Otherwise, like in this demo, we can leave it commented out.

[#trustee-pr]
=== A note on `policy.rego`

Under `policy.rego`, you can specify a custom Kata Agent policy. The default policy allows all API calls. For production environments, set `ReadStreamRequest` and `ExecProcessRequest` to `false` to disable the `oc exec` and `oc log` APIs, preventing unencrypted data transmission via the control plane. Adjust other `true` or `false` values to customize the policy further based on your needs. Note that if `ExecProcessRequest` is enabled, but `ReadStreamRequest` is not, the user can still inject commands, but won't be able to see the output. **This does not mean the command won't be executed**.

In this demo, we try something a bit more advanced: in order to securely allow the user to manually perform attestation, we restrict the `exec` commands to only allow the secret fetching, and nothing else. `allowed_commands` defines the only commands allowed to be exec'ed into the CoCo pod.

What the above means is that the defined command to `curl` `key1` will work, but **any** other command will fail. Even `oc exec -it pods/your_pod -- curl http://127.0.0.1:8006/cdh/resource/default/kbsres1/key2` will not work.

This is extremely useful if the pod has to provide restricted access to an untrusted actor (admin, developer) to for example debug the application logic inside the Confidential Container.

For more information about these policy please check https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/how-to/how-to-use-the-kata-agent-policy.md#encode-a-policy-file[alternative Kata policy, window=blank].

=== Measure the policy

Let's convert the policy in base64 and store it in the `INITDATA` variable.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
INITDATA=$(cat initdata.toml | gzip | base64 -w0)

echo $INITDATA
----

Now, let's calculate the expected value of PCR8, which will be given in the reference values to make sure that every CoCo pod actually uses this initdata config.

[source,sh,role=execute]

initial_pcr=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

[#trustee-conf]
== Configure Trustee

You can configure the following values, policies, and secrets for Trustee:

* xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-refval[Reference values]
* xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-ap[Attestation policy]
* xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-tdx[TDX ConfigMap] (**used in this workshop but optional for non-TDX instances**).
* xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-cisvp[Container image signature verification policy]
* xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-rap[Resource access policy]

In the sections below, we will elencate how to set up all these options, but for the purpose of the workshop, we will not enforce the image signature verification.

[#trustee-refval]
=== Reference values for the Reference Value Provider Service

**Purpose of this resource**: In an attestation scenario, the client (CoCo) collects measurements from the running software, the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) hardware and firmware and it submits a quote with the claims to the Attestation Server (Trustee, what we are setting right now). These measurements must match the trusted digests registered to the Trustee. This process ensures that the confidential VM (CVM) is running the expected software stack and has not been tampered with. By setting reference values, the user effectively defines the trusted digest (expected values) that Trustee expects from a valid client.

You can configure reference values for the Reference Value Provider Service (RVPS) by specifying the trusted digests of your hardware platform.

Red Hat currently ships an official CoCo podVM image together with its measurements. Therefore we simply need to insert the values into `rvps-configmap.yaml`. Such values ensure that CoCo is running that specific image, with a RH kernel and specific features like initdata policy enabled.

[#trustee-ap]
=== Attestation policy

**Purpose of this resource**: An attestation policy defines which part of the attestation report sent by the client (CoCo) is important for the Attester (Trustee), and how to compare the report with the reference values.

By default, Trustee has already an attestation policy. You can overwrite the default one by creating your own attestation policy.

The attestation policy follows the https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/policy-language[Open Policy Agent] specification.

The policy below checks the Platform Configuration Register (PCR) values `03`, `08`, `09`, `11`, and `12` against the reference values to ensure that the Confidential Containers pod uses the specified restrictive Kata agent policy and that the Red Hat pod VM image has not been altered. The attestation process is successful only if all the values match. For details, see https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/linux_tpm_pcr_registry/[Linux TPM PCR Registry] in the UAPI Group Specifications documentation.

=== Container image signature verification policy

**Purpose of this resource**: Sets wether to enforce or not the container image signature verification feature. If enabled, all containers images not signed by the trusted certificate provided in the xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-enable-sv[container image verification secret] will not be run.

The Trustee Operator returns this secret to the CoCo CVM components (which will run the CoCo pod) after attestation, to make sure they will perform the intended check. The CVM components will then compare the secret with the actual pod signature to determine whether to run it or not, ensuring that only trusted and authenticated container images are deployed in your environment.

You must in any case create the container image signature verification policy because signature verification is always enabled. If this policy is missing, the pods will not start.

In this workshop, we will use a policy that disables signature verification. In a production environment is of course strongly recommended to enable it.  You can use https://developers.redhat.com/products/trusted-artifact-signer/overview[Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer] or other tools to sign container images.

For more information on security policy, see https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md[containers-policy.json 5, =blank=blank].

. Create a `security-policy-config.json` that xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-enable-sv[enables] or xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-disable-sv[disables] signature verification.

. After `security-policy-config.json` is created, upload it as a secret with the following command:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc create secret generic security-policy \
  --from-file=osc=./security-policy-config.json \
  -n trustee-operator-system
----

IMPORTANT: Do not alter the secret type, `security-policy`, or the key, `osc`.

Note that `security-policy` will be later used in the xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-kbsconfig[KbsConfig]

----

[#trustee-enable-sv]
==== **Enable signature verification**

If you use container image signature verification, you must create a secret that contains the public container image signing key. In other words, if the container is not signed by a trusted signature, it shouldn't run.

Specify the type `$CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_TYPE` (for example `img-sig`), the tag `$CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_TAG` (for example `pub-key`), and `$CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_PK`, the public container image signing key.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_TYPE=type
CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_TAG=tag
CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_PK=public_key_file
----

Create a secret with the following command:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc create secret generic $CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_TYPE \
    --from-file=$CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_TAG=./$CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_PK \
    -n trustee-operator-system
----

Note that `$CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_TYPE` will be later used in the xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-kbsconfig[KbsConfig]

Then, create `security-policy-config.json`.

Specify the image repository for `$SECURITY_POLICY_TRANSPORT`, for example, `docker`:. For more information, see https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-transports.5.md[containers-transports 5, =blank=blank].

Specify the container `$SECURITY_POLICY_REGISTRY` and `$SECURITY_POLICY_IMAGE`, for example, `quay.io` and `my-image`.

Use the previously defined container image signature verification secret `tag` and `type` defined as `$CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_TYPE` and `$CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_TAG`.

For example, a Confidential Container image/workload could be encrypted, and the key to decrypt it is stored inside the Trustee and provided only if attestation is successful. In this section, we will show how to add the key into Trustee.

**Prerequisites:** You have created one or more custom keys. In this workshop, we will also create 2 keys.

Define secret name and values. In this example, the `kbsres1` secret has two entries (`key1`, `key2`), which the clients retrieve. You can add additional secrets according to your requirements by using the same format.

Create first the key:
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
openssl rand 128 > key.bin
----

We will add `key1` as a simple string containing the text `Confidential_Secret!`, and `key2` as `key.bin`.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc create secret generic kbsres1 \
  --from-literal key1=Confidential_Secret! \
  --from-file key2=key.bin \
  -n trustee-operator-system
----

Note that `kbsres1` will be later used in the xref:02-configure-trustee.adoc#trustee-kbsconfig[KbsConfig]

[#trustee-kbsconfig]
== Create the KbsConfig custom resource

To complete Trustee setup, you must create a `KbsConfig`.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat > kbsconfig-cr.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: confidentialcontainers.org/v1alpha1
kind: KbsConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: kbsconfig
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: kbsconfig
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: trustee-operator
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: trustee-operator
  name: kbsconfig
  namespace: trustee-operator-system
spec:
  kbsConfigMapName: kbs-config-cm
  kbsAuthSecretName: kbs-auth-public-key
  kbsDeploymentType: AllInOneDeployment
  kbsRvpsRefValuesConfigMapName: rvps-reference-values
  kbsSecretResources: ["kbsres1", "security-policy"]
  kbsResourcePolicyConfigMapName: resource-policy
  kbsAttestationPolicyConfigMapName: attestation-policy
  tdxConfigSpec:
    kbsTdxConfigMapName: tdx-config
  kbsServiceType: NodePort
EOF

cat kbsconfig-cr.yaml
----

If you did the optional steps:

* For enforced container image signature verification, extend `kbsSecretResources` list to also have the value of `$CONTAINER_IMAGE_SIGNATURE_TYPE`.
* If you are not planning to use TDX, disable the `tdxConfigSpec` section.
* Define `kbsServiceType` if you created a service type other than the default `ClusterIP` service to expose applications within the cluster external traffic. You can specify `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, or `ExternalName`. In this workshop, we will enable also `NodePort`.

Once the KbsConfig has been configured, apply it.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f kbsconfig-cr.yaml
----

=== Verification

Verify the Trustee configuration by checking the Trustee pods and logs.

. Check that both pods are up and running:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n trustee-operator-system
----
+
Expected output:
+
[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
trustee-deployment-8585f98449-9bbgl                    1/1     Running   0          22m
trustee-operator-controller-manager-5fbd44cd97-55dlh   2/2     Running   0          59m
----

. Check the KBS pod logs
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
POD_NAME=$(oc get pods -l app=kbs -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}' -n trustee-operator-system)

oc logs -n trustee-operator-system $POD_NAME
